# Frontend Masters Workshop App

This repo is for the workshop on "Building Modern Single-Page Web Applications" workshop at [Frontend Masters, June 2015](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/web-apps/).

**note:** the "master" branch contains the *completed* application. If you're just starting the video course you want to start with what's in the "start" branch. To do so, do this:

```
git clone https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/masters.git
cd masters
git fetch origin
git checkout -b start origin/start
npm install
npm start
```

- Switch it over to login with firebase
- Write module that fetches "all" repos (using github paging API)
- Add color picker?
